# Robot Localization 
Andrew Kurtz and Ananth Kutuva's robot localization project.

This is the base repo for the Olin Computational Robotics Robot Localization project, our final report is located in `Robot_Localization_Report.pdf`.

## Demo
This is a demo of the particle filter in action when initialized with a pose estimate.

The green arrows are particles, and the blue arrow is the estimated robot pose. The red dots show the robotâ€™s current laser scan transformed into the map frame using the estimated robot pose. The better the red dots align with the map, the better the pose.
